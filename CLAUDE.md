# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Agent Notify hooks into lifecycle events of AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, ZCode, Grok, Droid, OpenCode, OMP/oh-my-pi, DeepSeek Harness) and pushes notifications to desktop and phone (system notifications, Feishu, WeChat Work, DingTalk, Bark, ntfy, Slack). Distributed as a Go binary via an npx launcher (`npx agent-notify`) that downloads the platform binary from GitHub Releases into `~/.agent-notify/`.

## Commands

```bash
make build            # Build to bin/agent-notify (ldflags inject internal/cli.Version)
make test             # go test -v ./...
go test ./internal/notify -run TestName   # Run a single test
make lint             # golangci-lint run ./...
make fmt              # gofmt -s -w .
make vet              # go vet ./...

cd npx && npm test    # Node launcher tests (node --test)

make release VERSION=v0.x.y   # tag + push (triggers GH Actions release) + npm publish
```

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds a 6-target matrix on tag push and bundles the prebuilt helpers from `thirdparty/helper/` into the platform archives (macOS: terminal-notifier.app + mac-focus-helper; Windows: toast-focus-helper.exe).

## Architecture

The binary has two personalities:
1. **Interactive TUI** (`agent-notify` / `init`, `doctor`, `test`) — setup wizard that writes `~/.agent-notify/config.yaml` and installs hooks into each agent's config file.
2. **Hook handlers** (`handle-claude-hook`, `handle-codex-hook`, `handle-zcode-hook`, `handle-grok-hook`, `handle-droid-hook`, `handle-opencode-hook`, `handle-omp-hook`, `handle-dsh-hook`) — invoked by the agents themselves; read a hook event JSON from stdin, normalize it, and fan out notifications. These run headless and must never block or prompt.
3. **Direct sender** (`send`) — sends a custom message through one configured channel, bypassing agent event filtering and deduplication for explicit CLI calls.

Event flow: agent fires hook → `internal/cli/handler_*.go` → `internal/<agent>hooks/event.go` parses stdin JSON and maps agent-specific events to normalized events (`permission_required`, `input_required`, `run_completed`, `run_failed`, `session_start`) → `internal/agenthooks.Dispatch` → `internal/notify.Dispatcher.SendAll` fans out to enabled channel `Sender`s with dedupe.

Key packages:

- `internal/cli` — cobra commands, setup wizard menus/prompts (uses survey/v2).
- `internal/claudehooks`, `codexhooks`, `zcodehooks`, `grokhooks`, `droidhooks`, `opencodehooks`, `omphooks`, `dshhooks` — one package per agent, each with the same shape: `event.go` (stdin JSON → normalized `notify.Message`), settings/extension installation, and `handler.go` (glue). Adding an agent means adding a package with this shape plus entries in `internal/agentintegrations` and `internal/agenthooks/dispatch.go:buildSenders`.
- `internal/agenthooks` — `Dispatch`: detects source app from inherited env, resolves workspace, handles the `session_start` side-effect event (focus-window capture, never notifies), builds senders from per-agent config, dedupes, sends.
- `internal/notify` — one file per channel implementing `Sender`; `dispatcher.go` dedupes per (agent, session, event, content-hash, sender) via `internal/state`. System notifications are per-OS (`macos.go`, `linux.go`, `windows.go` + build-tagged variants).
- `internal/config` — `~/.agent-notify/config.yaml` schema. New installs start with all agents/channels disabled until the wizard enables them. `Load` unmarshals the YAML *into* `Default()`, so any key absent from a user's file inherits the default automatically — adding a field or an agent needs no change to `Load`. (It previously unmarshalled into a zero-value struct and hand-patched a list of fields; every field missed there silently got the Go zero value instead of its default, which is how `click_to_focus` ended up persisted as `false` for agents added after a user's config was first written.) When a default's *meaning* changes for existing files, bump `currentConfigVersion` and add a version-gated migration in `Load` (see `migrateV1ToV2`).
- `internal/state` — file-backed dedupe reservations, focus-window cache (keyed by session ID), append-only log.
- `internal/linuxfocus`, `internal/winfocus`, `internal/notify/macos.go` — click-to-focus: clicking a system notification refocuses the originating terminal/IDE window. Linux uses X11/EWMH window IDs; macOS/Windows use bundled helper binaries and window snapshots captured at `session_start`. macOS precision is controlled by `AGENT_NOTIFY_FOCUS_PRECISION` (`app` default / `window`).
- `internal/i18n` — TUI localization (zh-CN default, en-US); notification text formatting lives separately in `internal/notify/format.go` and is not affected by TUI locale.
- `npx/` — Node launcher (CommonJS, no runtime deps beyond `tar`): version-checks and downloads the release binary, then execs it by absolute path. `npm run prepack` syncs the repo README into the package.

## Conventions

- Code comments are predominantly Chinese; match the surrounding file's style.
- ZCode's hook schema is strict — an unknown event name silently drops the entire hooks config, so be careful editing `internal/zcodehooks/settings.go`.
- OpenCode has no native hook system; instead it uses a JS plugin (embedded via `go:embed` in `internal/opencodehooks/plugin_embed.js`, distributed to `~/.agent-notify/opencode-plugin.js`). The plugin path is registered in OpenCode's `opencode.json` `plugin` array (user: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, project: `./opencode.json`). Events: `session.created`→`session_start`, `permission.asked`→`permission_required`, `question.asked`→`input_required`, `session.status`(idle)→`input_required`, `session.idle`→`run_completed`, `session.error`→`run_failed`. Note: OpenCode's `session.next.*` events are internal and never published to plugins — only the documented Session Events reach the plugin. A pending `question.asked` (the `ask` tool's choice form) leaves the session `busy`, so no idle event fires — it must stay explicitly subscribed in the plugin's allowlist; `TestPluginSubscriptionMatchesParser` guards that the JS allowlist and `ParseMessage` stay in sync.
- Hook handlers log failures to the state log file and return nil rather than erroring loudly (an agent's hook must not break the agent).
- DeepSeek Harness has no JSON hook file: it uses a Cordis plugin shipped as a separate npm package (`agent-notify-dsh`), so `internal/dshhooks/settings.go` manages the package (`dsh plugin --profile <p> add ...`) rather than a config file, and the profile is resolved from `DSH_HOME`/`AGENT_NOTIFY_DSH_PROFILE`. The plugin subscribes to the harness's own extension points (the bundled Claude Code hook bridge only recognises `SessionStart` and `Stop`, silently dropping `PermissionRequest`). `dsh print-hooks` emits the install plan for the wizard.
- `docs/` is tracked (design docs and logo concepts live there); only `docs/superpowers` is ignored.
