## Overview

Agent Notify hooks into the lifecycle events of AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, ZCode, Grok, Droid, OMP/oh-my-pi, DeepSeek Harness, etc.) and pushes them to your phone and desktop. Get notified the moment your agent needs permission, finishes a task, or fails — so you never have to babysit a running agent.

Supported delivery channels: **OS-native system notifications**, **Feishu/Lark**, **WeChat Work (企业微信)**, **DingTalk (钉钉)**, **Bark (iOS)**, and **ntfy**.

## Quick Start

Run it without installing anything:

```bash
npx agent-notify@latest
```

Or install it globally, which puts the `agent-notify` command on your `PATH`:

```bash
npm install -g agent-notify
agent-notify
```

Update a global install later:

```bash
npm update -g agent-notify
```

Both routes run the same launcher: it downloads the platform binary into `~/.agent-notify/` on first run, so the npm package itself is only a bootstrap. The launcher updates the binary to the version of the **npm package it was invoked from**, never to whatever is newest — so keep that package current: `npx agent-notify@latest` re-resolves from the registry on every run, while a global install only moves when you run `npm update -g agent-notify`. The global install is the better fit if you plan to call `agent-notify` directly — `agent-notify doctor`, `agent-notify send`, `agent-notify freeze` — rather than going through `npx` every time. Pin a version with `npm install -g agent-notify@0.17.0`.

You can also send a custom message directly through a configured channel:

```bash
agent-notify send --channel wechat-work --agent omp "Deployment finished; please check the service"
agent-notify send --channel ntfy --agent omp --title "Build result" --message "Build succeeded"
```

`send` reads the selected agent's channel configuration and sends explicitly, regardless of that channel's `enabled` flag or event subscription list. Supported channels are `system`, `feishu`, `wechat`, `wechat-work`, `dingtalk`, `bark`, `ntfy`, and `slack`.

### Supported Events

| Event | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode | ZCode | Grok | Droid | OMP | DSH |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `permission_required` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅* | ✅ |
| `input_required` | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `run_completed` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `run_failed` | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ |

Notes:

- Claude Code subscribes via hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`: `PermissionRequest`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `PostToolUseFailure`, and `SessionStart`.
- Codex subscribes via `~/.codex/hooks.json`: `PermissionRequest` and `Stop` (mapped to `permission_required` / `run_completed`), plus `SessionStart`. `input_required` and `run_failed` have no corresponding Codex hook yet, so they are not supported.
- OpenCode uses a JS plugin instead of native hooks: the plugin is written to `~/.agent-notify/opencode-plugin.js` (binary path baked into JS), and its path is registered in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (user) or `./opencode.json` (project) `plugin` array. The plugin subscribes to `session.created`→`session_start`, `permission.asked`→`permission_required`, `question.asked`→`input_required`, `session.status`(idle)→`input_required`, `session.idle`→`run_completed`, `session.error`→`run_failed`.
- ZCode subscribes via `~/.zcode/cli/config.json`: `SessionStart`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUseFailure`, and `Stop`, mapped to `permission_required`, `run_failed`, and `run_completed`. ZCode has no `Notification` event (so no `input_required`), and its hook schema is strict — an unknown event name will cause the whole hooks config to be silently dropped.
- Grok subscribes via `~/.grok/hooks/agent-notify.json`: `SessionStart`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`, and `PostToolUseFailure`. There is no dedicated `PermissionRequest` event; `Notification`s with permission/approval semantics map to `permission_required` (marked *), others map to `input_required`. `StopFailure` / `PostToolUseFailure` map to `run_failed`.
- Droid subscribes via `~/.factory/hooks.json`: `SessionStart`, `Notification`, `Stop`, mapped to `session_start` / `permission_required`|`input_required` / `run_completed`. Droid has no failure event, so `run_failed` is not supported. `session_start` is only used for click-to-focus window capture, not as a notification event.
- OMP uses a native TypeScript extension instead of a JSON command hook: user scope writes `~/.omp/agent/extensions/agent-notify.ts`, while project scope writes `.omp/extensions/agent-notify.ts`. It listens to `session_start`, `tool_approval_requested`, `tool_execution_start`, and `session_stop`, mapping them to focus capture, `permission_required`, `input_required`, and `run_completed`/`run_failed`. The `ask` tool blocks the session waiting for an answer, so its `tool_execution_start` is mapped to `input_required`. A run is judged by `session_stop`'s stop reason: `stop_reason: "error"` (or an aborted stop with an error message) maps to `run_failed`; ordinary per-tool errors are not treated as run failures. `permission_required` is emitted only when OMP actually requests tool approval.
- OMP respects `OMP_PROFILE` / `PI_PROFILE` profiles and the `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` override.
- DeepSeek Harness uses a native Cordis plugin (the separate [`agent-notify-dsh`](https://github.com/wanfanggreat/agent-notify-dsh) package) instead of a JSON command hook. The plugin subscribes directly to the harness's lifecycle extension points — `agent/created`→`session_start`, `approval/request`→`permission_required`, `user-questions/request`→`input_required`, `agent/turn-stopping`→`run_completed`, `agent/error`→`run_failed` — and spawns `agent-notify handle-dsh-hook` detached, never blocking the agent. Install it with `dsh plugin --profile web add agent-notify-dsh`. This native route is deliberate: DSH's bundled Claude Code hook bridge only recognises `SessionStart` and `Stop`, so `PermissionRequest` and `Notification` would be dropped silently, losing the pending-authorization alert that matters most. Only root agents are reported; subagent events are filtered to avoid notification spam.
- **`SessionStart` does not produce a notification.** It is subscribed on every agent solely to capture the terminal window at session start, which powers Linux window-level [Click-to-Focus](#click-to-focus). On macOS/Windows the SessionStart hook is a no-op.

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| macOS | amd64 / arm64 | ✅ |
| Linux | amd64 / arm64 | ✅ |
| Windows | amd64 / arm64 | ✅ |

### Click-to-Focus

System notifications are clickable — clicking one brings you back to the terminal / window where the agent is running. Behavior differs by platform:

- **macOS** — App-level by default (activates the agent's terminal/IDE app). For window-level focus (return to the exact window even when several are open), set `AGENT_NOTIFY_FOCUS_PRECISION=window` in your login shell environment (e.g. `~/.zshrc`); this uses a bundled helper and requires Accessibility permission. Unset stays app-level.
- **Linux (X11)** — Window-level. The exact terminal window is captured at session start (via the `SessionStart` hook) and re-focused on click, so it distinguishes sibling windows of single-process terminals (deepin-terminal, GNOME Terminal, etc.). Native Wayland windows can't be targeted.
- **Windows** — Returns to the terminal window via a bundled helper.

> **`AGENT_NOTIFY_FOCUS_PRECISION`** accepts `window` (window-level) or `app` (app-level — the default). Values are case-insensitive and whitespace-trimmed; anything unset or unrecognized falls back to `app`. This variable **only affects macOS** — Linux is always window-level, and Windows uses its own helper.

Click-to-focus is enabled by default for the System channel; the target app/window is detected automatically from the hook's environment and process tree.




## Configuration

On first run, the launcher downloads the platform-specific binary matching the current npm package version from GitHub Releases and installs it to:

- macOS / Linux: `~/.agent-notify/agent-notify`
- Windows: `~/.agent-notify/agent-notify.exe`

On every subsequent run it checks the local binary version against the version of the npm package the launcher ran from: it downloads if missing, updates if it differs, and otherwise runs directly. Invoke with `npx agent-notify@latest` (or run `npm update -g agent-notify`) to move to a new release. The launcher never persistently modifies `PATH` — it always executes via an absolute path.

> **Note**: Codex integrates through the official hooks system in `~/.codex/hooks.json` and currently subscribes only to `PermissionRequest` and `Stop`. After first install, run `/hooks` inside Codex to complete the trust review.
>
> **Grok**: Writes `~/.grok/hooks/agent-notify.json`. Global hooks are always trusted; project hooks (`.grok/hooks/`) require `/hooks-trust` or `--trust`. After install, run `/hooks` (or `Ctrl+L`) inside Grok to confirm they loaded.


> You don't need to edit config files by hand — this section is for reference only.

Agent Notify's own config lives at `~/.agent-notify/config.yaml`. **New installs start with all agents and channels disabled** — run `npx agent-notify@latest` (setup wizard) once to enable the agents and channels you want. This avoids showing unconfigured agents as ready in view/doctor after a partial setup. Existing config files are left unchanged.

Agent integration config locations:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/settings.json` (writes hooks → command `agent-notify handle-claude-hook`)
- Codex: `~/.codex/hooks.json` (writes hooks → command `agent-notify handle-codex-hook`; run `/hooks` inside Codex to complete trust)
- OpenCode: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (writes `plugin` array → `~/.agent-notify/opencode-plugin.js`, command `agent-notify handle-opencode-hook`; project scope uses `./opencode.json`)
- ZCode: `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` (writes `hooks.events.<Event>` + `hooks.enabled` → command `agent-notify handle-zcode-hook`; restart ZCode for the config to take effect)
- Grok: `~/.grok/hooks/agent-notify.json` (writes hooks → command `agent-notify handle-grok-hook`; project scope uses `.grok/hooks/agent-notify.json`)
- Droid: `~/.factory/hooks.json` (writes hooks → command `agent-notify handle-droid-hook`; project scope uses `.factory/hooks.json`)
- OMP: `~/.omp/agent/extensions/agent-notify.ts` (writes a native TypeScript extension; project scope uses `.omp/extensions/agent-notify.ts`)
- DeepSeek Harness: `<DSH_HOME>/profiles/<profile>/package.json` (registers the `agent-notify-dsh` bundle; the install itself runs `dsh plugin --profile <profile> add agent-notify-dsh`. DSH has no project-level install location)

### WeChat Work Bot Binding Tip

1. **Create a single-person notification group**: start a group chat in WeChat Work (pull in a few colleagues). After it's created, **do not post anything**, then remove the others — the group becomes your personal notification channel.
2. **Add a bot**: "Group Settings" → "Message Push" → "Add" → "Custom Message Push", name it and save.
3. **Get the webhook URL**: copy the generated URL, which looks like `https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/webhook/send?key=xxx`.
4. **Bind it**: run `npx agent-notify@latest`, enable the WeChat Work channel in the setup wizard, and paste the webhook URL.
> Older WeChat Work versions: "Group Settings" → "Group Bots" → "Add Bot" → "New Bot", name it and save.
